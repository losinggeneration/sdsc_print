# An example using SDSC Debug Console

This example uses SDCC & WLA-DX to demonstrate writing to the SDSC Debug Console as
specified [here](http://www.smspower.org/Development/SDSCDebugConsoleSpecification).
[CrabEmu](http://crabemu.sourceforge.net/) for OSX & Linux (with Qt) support the
Debug Console. I didn't exhaustively check others, but didn't see others obviously
implementing it.
